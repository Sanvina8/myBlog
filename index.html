            <h1>Console web app by Sanvi</h1>

        <p>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which 
            runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes 
            with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node</p>

            <p>A screen buffer is a two-dimensional array of character and color data 
                for output in a console window. A console can have multiple screen 
                buffers. The active screen buffer is the one that is displayed on the 
                screen. The system creates a screen buffer whenever it creates a new 
                console.</p>

                    console.log(first_name.concat(last_name));
